\chapter{Preface: What Is This Project?}
This aims to be a beautiful coloured {\LaTeX} template for everyone to enjoy, for taking notes, writing a book, and more. 

But there are so many {\LaTeX} templates available online already, why another? This started as a personal project to revise my {\LaTeX} setup, to make it more convenient and hassle free, as well as to improve the aesthetics of my documents. Over time, I refined this template to what it is today and wanted everyone to be able to enjoy its use; naturally, I'm releasing it under the \extref{https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/}{LPPL 1.3}. (Moreover, coloured templates seem unfortunately rare?)

I have learnt a bit more about {\LaTeX} programming over the course of this project, but I'm still a mere amateur. So, while feedback is greatly appreciated, please don't be too harsh on me when you spot some abominable code --- I try to write decent {\TeX} and update it when I find out bad practices I engage in.
